# Derive 6.1 Online Help

[Derive 6.1](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Derive_(computer_algebra_system))'s online help, a discontinued CAS software developed by Texas Instruments. Most of its content is valid regarding Derive 5.xx, too.

## How was Made

This repository basically contains a conversion of Texas Instruments' Derive 6.1 WinHelp [online help](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Online_help) authored through [HelpNDoc](https://www.helpndoc.com/), and deployed as a HTML website using GitHub Pages.

Output is stored as a whole inside the `docs` subfolder for better repository organization, can be read directly in your browser [here](https://waluigibsod.github.io/derive6.1-online-help/).

### Source Files

Source files from the program are not included, but here is a listing of their [SHA-256](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SHA-2) hashes:

* ROBOEX32.DLL - `3785CF518318789AC99DAF9B30FE3E8AA02214B83D0E0653F4ADD2E5AE0194FD`
* Derive6.cnt - `38ED11AB7CBB217B045A22B574C3A4B1616E79AC3A988560C7F94C968CA732F7`
* Derive6.hlp - `5D3FD7F7C1970A1A6450114CF97F9FE711BABD1CB9A6CBB625F72C8B5EEF8C99`

They can be found in any copy of the original software, in the root installation directory.

## License

Unlike other stuff hosted on this GitHub account, being basically almost entrirely a release to something belonging to a third-party under the fair use doctrine, no license is available.

But the only thing I'm asking in exchange is to give me credit for this conversion if you mirror all of this somewhere outside [the original WaluigiBSOD repository](https://github.com/WaluigiBSOD/derive6.1-online-help).
